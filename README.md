# CSS Challenges

- Challenge 1: Fonts and Colours: This challenge focused on colouring the text and headings on the website. Internal coding was created into the html file.
- Challenge 2: Proceeded with all code provided and edited where needed. The challanged mainly focused on links, borders, side bars and hovering. A backgound colour with a gradient was selected to give it a elegant feel.
- Challenge 3: In this challenge I had to insert a declaration background and a backgound with the fallback if the first one does not load. I also inserted a png logo as briefed. I then moved on to the cool box where everything was styled internally.
- Challenge 4 Float Box Challenge: By contructing individual boxes and floating some left and right I learned to create and divide sections. This challenge also helped me to hover over certain boxes with different properties.
- Challenge 5 Google Font Challenge: This helped me to use different methods to load google fonts into my website. 
- Challenge 6 Styling: Here I learned to implement styling to a form by creating my own coffee shop survey.
- Challenge 7 Speech Bubble: In this challenge I created a speech bubble using shapes and proper position in order to get a perfect speech bubble.
- Challenge 8 Sale Banner: Here I learned to create a banner in the corner of the page. To be specific I created a sale banner for a clothing store.
- Challenge 9 Emoji: In this challenge I was given the task to position and make shapes in order to create a smiley face.
